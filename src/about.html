      Who am I?
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I am Stetson. This site is a public record of my attemps to understand the
      technological world, and to speak it's language.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      My history of learning to program is scattered and
      <span class="font-bold">long</span>. I started with Ruby, but didn't get
      far, like maybe 2 weeks far. Then I dabbled with Wordpress/PHP, but didn't
      stick with it. Then plain old HTML and CSS which I learned well enough to
      build a few sites.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      In 2018 I did a coding bootcamp focused on the MERN stack (not nearly as
      cool sounding as the MEAN stack in my opinion) and that was my first
      journey into Javascript.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Between programming stints I started two compaines.

      In 2019 I sold my painting company and 2020 was the year I got serious
      about learning Javascript and doing something with it.

    <h2 class="my-6 text-2xl">What I'll Write About Here</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I've read A LOT of material on learning to code. I've watched A LOT of
      videos and
      <span class="text-teal-500 font-bold italic">in my opinion</span> most "educators" assume that they know what you need to learn.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">I'm going to try something different.  I'm going to tell you <span class="text-teal-500 font-bold italic">what worked for me</span> and <span class="text-teal-500 font-bold italic">why I went about it that way.</span>  I'll make 0 assumptions about it being the way you should do it.</p>
    <p><span class="font-bold">Note: </span>I'm going to be wrong a lot.  I know slightly more than nothing and am far from an expert.  Hopefully reading about me struggling through figuring things out is helpful for you.</p>
