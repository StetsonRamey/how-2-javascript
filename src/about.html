      Who am I?
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I am Stetson. This site is me figuring out how hack make websites I enjoy
      visiting. Writing seems to help my mind envelop concepts, so I'm writing
      to figure stuff out.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      My history of learning to program is scattered and
      <span class="font-bold">long</span>. I started with Ruby, but didn't get
      far, maybe 2 weeks far. Then I dabbled with Wordpress/PHP, but didn't
      stick with it. Then plain old HTML and CSS which I learned well enough to
      build a few sites.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      In 2018 I did a coding bootcamp focused on the

      stack (not nearly as cool sounding as the MEAN stack in my opinion) and
      that was my first journey into Javascript.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Between programming stints I started two compaines.

      about learning Javascript and doing something with it.

    <h2 class="my-6 text-2xl">What I'll Write About Here</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Learning to code continually challenges me. There is an overwhelming
      amount of information on the internet and I find most of it is opinionated
      or biased in some way. Simply parsing the information and finding what is
      useful to me takes time and effort.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      My objective is to build
      <span class="text-demoBorder">simple websites</span> which are
      <span class="text-demoBorder">screaming fast</span> and low overhead on
      developer setup and maintenance. For me,
      <span class="text-demoBorder">simplicity is king</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I wish that pro coders and hackers showed me how to use their tools, like
      personally held my hand and showed me, but with a few exceptions most do
      not. So I'm going to approach my writing about these tools in that way.
      I'll write about my
      <span class="text-demoBorder">personal setup and implementation</span>
      starting with the <span class="text-demoBorder">bare bones</span> setups
      and <span class="text-demoBorder">layering on abstraction</span> along the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="font-bold">Note: </span>I'm going to be wrong a lot. I know
      slightly more than nothing and am far from an expert. If anyone even reads
      about me struggling through figuring things out, I hope you find it
      helpful.

    <h2 class="text-2xl">A Brief History of Me and How I Got Here</h2>
    <ul class="list-outside list-disc">
      <li><strong>1986: </strong>Born in Newcastle, Wyoming. Oldest of 3.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1997: </strong>My family moves to Cheyenne, Wyoming. My dad is a
        pilot and takes a job in Cheyenne and gets to fly Jets ðŸ›©. Cheyenne is
        the big city in Wyoming, though almost ANYWHERE else, it is not.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2003: </strong>My mother encourages me to take a few classes at
        the community college. I agree.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2003 - 2005: </strong>I like math and it makes sense to me. The
        professor teaching Calculus is the head engineering professor and
        encourages me to major in engineering. I graduate with an associates in
        Math and an associates in Engineering and transfer to the University of
        Wyoming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2005-2009: </strong>I study Civil Engineering, graduate with my
        B.S., and hang around for an extra year and get a Master's Degree in
        Geotechnical Engineering.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2009: </strong>Two companies offer me positions. One is an oil
        services company. The job is to work on the off-shore rigs in the Gulf
        of Mexico. It sounds like they own you and your time, but they pay
        really well. The other job is from a large contractor working for their
        group who builds only power projects (power plants) and their
        headquarters is in Kansas City. I go for power plants and Kansas City.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2010: </strong>I get moved to Morristown, TN to work on my first
        live project. I work ALOT, and mostly night shift, and begin to think
        perhaps I don't want to go this route long term.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2011: </strong>I request to move to Long Beach, CA to work on a
        new power project there. My request is granted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2011-2012: </strong>A consulting company in LA hires me. I
        decide to try the engineering side instead of the construction side of
        things. I end up working mostly with the same contractor, but with their
        transportation group on large bridge projects. Still working a fair
        amount of night shift, and still traveling and working ALOT.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2012-2015: </strong>A friend opens a gym in Sioux Falls, SD and
        asks me to come work for him and help him build it up. I do, and learn
        how to build a business, market, sell, lead, and get in really good
        shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2015-2017: </strong>I decide I need to start my own business.
        Without much consideration or strategy, I move back to Kansas City and
        start a house painting company. The internet and books and podcasts
        warned me it would be hard, but starting a business is the hardest thing
        I've ever done. It gets a little easier after about 3 years.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2017-2019: </strong>The guy I hired as a project manager for the
        painting company pitches me on starting a holiday lighting company. I
        push him off for a while, but we do in 2017. Holiday lighting turns out
        to be a great little business and we have a lot of fun doing it. It was
        much easier for us to get going than the painting company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2018 / 2019: </strong>I'm tired of not being able to get the
        results I want in a website, and decide I need to learn how to code
        sites myself. I take a coding bootcamp and learn enough to build our
        holiday lighting business website myself. It goes great, ranks #1 on
        google search, and brings in a ton of leads during our busy season. I
        sell my painting company to my (now friend) PM and move to CA. I return
        to Kansas City September to January to run our holiday light season.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2020: </strong>COVID hits, and I decide it's the perfect time
        for me to learn Javascript and get serious about building websites.

      think they have great ideas and communicate them well. If I say anything
      intelligent, it's probably because I learned it from them.
