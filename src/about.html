    <p class="mb-6">
      My history of learning to program is scattered and
      <span class="font-bold">long</span>. I started with Ruby, but didn't get
      far, maybe 2 weeks far. Then I dabbled with Wordpress/PHP, but didn't
      stick with it. Then plain old HTML and CSS which I learned well enough to
      build a few sites.

    <p class="mb-6">
      In 2018 I did a coding bootcamp focused on the

      stack (not nearly as cool sounding as the MEAN stack in my opinion) and
      that was my first journey into Javascript.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Between programming stints I started two compaines.

      about learning Javascript and doing something with it.

    <h2 class="my-6 text-2xl">What I'll Write About Here</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I've read A LOT of material on learning to code. I've watched A LOT of
      videos and
      <span class="text-teal-500 font-bold italic">in my opinion</span> most
      "educators" assume that they know what you need to learn. But I don't need
      to build an e-commerce site with React that would "scale" (whatever that
      means).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I need to build fast beautiful sites for my business that are WAAAAY
      faster than Wordpress, kill at SEO, and that I don't have to continually
      update plugins for!
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I'm going to try something different. I'm going to tell you
      <span class="text-teal-500 font-bold italic">what worked for me</span> and
      <span class="text-teal-500 font-bold italic"
        >why I went about it that way.</span
      >
      I'll make 0 assumptions about it being the way you should do it. To the
      greatest extent possible, I also want to begin with the simplest possible
      example and layer on complexity slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="font-bold">Note: </span>I'm going to be wrong a lot. I know
      slightly more than nothing and am far from an expert. If anyone even reads
      about me struggling through figuring things out, I hope you find it
      helpful.
