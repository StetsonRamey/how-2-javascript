      I'm learning Javascript. That's mostly what this site is about. For me,
      learning to code is hard and writing about it helps me. I educated as a
      Civil Engineer, own/run a couple of small service businesses, speak
      spanish pretty well, and am still contemplating the best use of my time.

      This website has no ads or trackers, no third party scripts, no writing
      from anyone but me, no affiliate links, no empty sales pitches, or any of
      the other bullshit I'm tired of seeing on the internet.

    I'll get this setup soon. I'll never send you anything spammy or lame, and
    at least until the time that I believe I can add value and work out the
    details of a better model to do so than currently exists, I'll never attempt
    to sell you anything.

  <h2>Search</h2>
  <p>
    I'm going to work on <em>rolling my own</em> search (as I've seen others
    say) in lieu of adding a library or third party search tool. It's not
    critical until there are numerous posts anyway.
