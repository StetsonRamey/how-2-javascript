      I'm an aspiring developer, curious engineer, voracious reader, and
      terrible writer. This website is mostly a place where I intend to figure
      things out that I'm interested in.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-screen-sm">
      This website has no ads or trackers, no third party scripts, no writing
      from anyone but me, no affiliate links, no empty sales pitches, or any of
      the other bullshit I'm tired of seeing on the internet.
    </p>
    <p class="max-w-screen-sm">
      I hope you enjoy reading what I <a href="/web/blog">write</a>. I'll try
      and make it direct, easy, and clear. Feel free to shoot me an email at
      <span class="font-semibold">stetson.ramey@gmail.com</span>.

    <p class="text-base italic text-red-600 max-w-screen-sm">
      emails regarding ads or sponsored posts...no thank you plus I have zero
      traffic. If you're a headhunter, don't bother unless the money is
      absolutely ridiculous, or it's Tesla or SpaceX.

  <h2>Newsletter</h2>
  <p>
    I'll get this setup soon. I'll never send you anything spammy or lame, and
    at least until the time that I believe I can add value and work out the
    details of a better model to do so than currently exists, I'll never attempt
    to sell you anything.

  <h2>Search</h2>
  <p>
    I'm going to work on <em>rolling my own</em> search (as I've seen others
    say) in lieu of adding a library or third party search tool. It's not
    critical until there are numerous posts anyway.
